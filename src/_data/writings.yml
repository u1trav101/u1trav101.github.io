    "two comets on a trajectory for eachother
    <br><br>
    they meet and orbit, locked in eachother's embrace
    <br><br>
    the energy builds, they spin too fast
    <br><br>
    they can't hold on to eachother
    <br><br>
    and so off they shoot, into the dark and cold
    <br><br>
    noone's fault but a universal constant; a balancing sum"
